# 5 useful functions for your Time Series projects in Data Science

These 5 functions are presented in a YouTube video :  *[Equancy YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2LEbd7POe95hDui_hIgH7g/featured)*

They perform regular tasks in a multivariate time series project and allow the Data Scientist not to have to create them himself.
